# Java Practice

This respository is full of different lessons from a java UDEMY class. <br>

The repository itself is going to constantly be updated with new codes as I learn more. Currently 
at the time of this writing I have filled the repo with code pertaining to Arrays, Composition,
Encapsulation, Inheritance, OOPChallenge, Polymorphism, and Constuctors. <br>

Making this repository was, and still is, very important to me. It has allowed me to reaquaint the basics
of java. Also, it has allowed me to further reinforce my learning of slightly more advanced topics
that are important to know for software development in the future.

# Code Examples<br>

Here is a snapshot from the Array's main class. This shows a printing of all the elements in an arraylist. <br>

Here is a snapshot from the Encapsulation's Printer class. It acts as an actual printer to tell the user about toner level, if the printer is normal or duplex, and how many pages are printed. <br>

# Motivation

I wanted to take on this project to make myself more comforatable with Java as a language. Before starting on this UDEMY class, I was not
confident in my ability to program. After going through, what I would say, is about 25% of the course, I can confidently say that Java
does not scare me anymore and no challenge seems to big to solve.
